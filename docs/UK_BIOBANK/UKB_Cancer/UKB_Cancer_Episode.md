# CDM Table name: Episode

## Reading from STEM  

All mapped cancer diagnoses in CDM Condition are additionally mapped to the CDM Episode, with episode_concept_id set to [32533 (Disease Episode)](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/32533) and episode_object_concept_id assigned to the corresponding condition_concept_id. Furthermore, all related cancer diagnosis modifiers, regardless of their target domain, are linked to the CDM Episode using the same episode_id via episode_event.
